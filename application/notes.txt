Max  tm_categories.code length is 32 cuz mysql won't set it as unique index if its more than this

Default:
Default welcome msg: id=1
Default service: id=1
Default cat: id=1


There must be a default user with an ID of 1

--
Because of the use of Foriegn keys in the  DB, the DB engine MUST BE INNO DB!!
--------
The category name must be <= 32 chars
---------------
In the far future try to make the welcome_msg field in the cat. contain more than 70 letters for ENGLISH

in the delphi application The settings only loads at the start of the program, if updated afterwards it won't be updated until the program restarts

for the Delphi app , in case the DB failed then ( at 1st or in the middle ) then do a timed loop to try again after some time
